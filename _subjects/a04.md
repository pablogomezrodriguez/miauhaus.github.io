course: miau
code: A04
description: Introducing the students to the tools and aptitudes for the creation of virtual scenarios and situations
simulating restricted live physical conditions. The aim is to acquire the ability to model complex livealike
systems such as tensile structures, inflatables, minimal surfaces, unfoldable surfaces, depoyable
structures and analyse its behaviour as a force and vector input’s result through time.
