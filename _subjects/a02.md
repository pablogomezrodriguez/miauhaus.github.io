description: Generation, nature and properties of form based on chosen custom design inputs. We introduce students
to relational ways of generating and analyzing architecture using visual programming. A project based
learning method will allow to elaborate a useful catalog of morphogenerative protocols and tools that
can be used on project making situations. The student will acquire as well a critical capacity about digital
and parametrical tools. During this seminar, dicussions about some of the current architectural fashions
related to these tools will be held.

### Milestone:
An adaptative procedural environment open to student’s speculative proposals
