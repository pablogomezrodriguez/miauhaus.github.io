## A.06 MDS Multidisciplinary Design Systems
Number of Sessions/Duration 2 (5 hours)

### Seminar’s description:
Dynamic and interrelated model programming as a 3D framewrok to cross different disciplines routines.
Conceived as a disciplinary environments solutions (such as the structural, bioclimatic or infrastructure
subsystem) integrated into a whole analysis system, the aim is to understand the project as an interrelated
subsystem assembly. In the same way, the aim is to learn the basics of evolutionary design applied to a
project and thus, combined with other’s subject content, turning digital tools into useful prospective tools
for projecting.   

### Milestone:
Full analysis of the built procedural adaptative environment and collaborative set of tools.
