## A.05 APP Advanced Prototyping Parametrization
Number of Sessions/Duration 3 (7.5 hours)

### Seminar’s description:
Responsive architectural parametric prototypes through visual programming. This seminar will seek to
combine the visual programming’s concepts and protocols to full reactive and adaptative prototypes
and its context. This seminar opens the possiblity to the interpretation and exchange of the generated
geometry and its attributes to BIM formats and models. 

### Milestone:
The exercise for this seminar is linked to Multidisciplinary Design Sytems’s milestone
